6. Go back to your command prompt and do *node baconhawk.js* to start the bot
7. If no errors appear than the bot was set-up correctly

# Modules
Many of you may be wondering what modules are, in BaconHawkJS modules are .js files that are located in a folder inside the *modules* folder. Each module, or .js file, adds its own unique command to the bot that is auto-loaded into the bot with the *modules.js* file. The frame work comes pre installed with a few modules for you to look off. There are sub categories inside the main *modules* folder for you to nicely organize your modules into folders! An example *{module}.js* file will be below.

```javascript
exports.module = "<command_name>";

exports.<command_name> = {
  run: function(bot,suffix,msg) {
    //your code here
  }
}

```
